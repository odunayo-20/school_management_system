                            Our Nursery and Primary school accepts children in the age group of 2 to 10 years.
                            Children can then progress to Nursery department. The
                            academic thrust of the Nursery and Primary school is central to our purpose. Major
                            emphasis is placed on providing individual attention to enable every child perform to
                            the best of their ability. The school is well resourced for teaching all subjects. Our
                            academic programme allows pupils to discover talents in everything from the classroom,
                            assembly presentations, games, sporting activities, art exhibitions and musical shows.
                            We encourage and reward learning and achievements. The balance of individuals and
                            communal commitment fostered at Ogooluwa School will enrich and guide a life of personal
                            fulfillment as well as service to others. The library is well stocked with reference
                            books, reading trees and fictions. Pupils are encouraged from an early age to make use
                            of the library. A book review is held annually to encourage reading. Ogooluwa teachers
                            are dedicated to helping each child develop their unique talents. We realize that
                            learning must take place in a fun and nurturing environment. We also recognize that
                            parents’ involvement is important to children's success in school. Parents are
                            encouraged to communicate frequently and openly with teachers and the school leadership.
